Alice and Bob are going to play a game of chance. 
Alice has twenty 6-sided dice, and Bob has six 20-sided dice. 
They will each roll all of their dice, and whoever has the highest total wins. 
If the totals are the same, it is a tie. 
For example, if Alice were to roll (3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 6, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 5, 6, 1, 4, 4, 1, 3) 
and Bob were to roll (15, 13, 13, 7, 12, 19), then Alice's total would be 63 and Bob's total would be 79, so Bob would win.

What is the probability that Alice will win?
